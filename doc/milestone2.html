<p>We have met with our fellow teammates and teaching fellow to craft the

<h2>Project Statement &amp; Problem Trying to Solve<a class="headerlink" href="#Project-Statement-&-Problem-Trying-to-Solve" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>While soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, its
analytics is lackluster in comparison to other popular sports such as
baseball, American football, hockey, and basketball. This is due to the
fact that aside from the World Cup, international teams donât play each
other very frequently. Therefore, there is a lack of high quality data
that can be immediately fed into models to perform predictions. Thus, we
are interested in collecting data from various different sources and
perform feature engineering to produce highly relevant features for
soccer analytics. Finally, our end goal is to predict the results of
World Cup as accurately as possible, while analyzing what factors might
be significant in predicting the results. The World Cup is composed of
64 matches in total - 48 matches in group stages and 16 matches in
knockout (15 + 1 for third place). We plan to predict the outcome of
each of the 64 matches independently instead of predicting which teams
proceed in each round. This strategy allows our results to be comparable
across models. By framing the problem in this way, we plan to approach
this problem as a classification problem. Each game can be treated as a
multi-class classification problem, where there are three outcomes: win
for the home team (or team 1), win for the away team (or team 2), or a
draw. In the case of knockouts, we limit the outcome to: win for the
home team (or team 1), win for the away team (or team 2), as draws are
not allowed. To validate how accurate FIFA rankings are, we also aim to
use a baseline model that leverages FIFA rankings and some other simple
predictors to predict the World Cup results. Along with that, we will
also evaluate some simple baseline models such as randomly predicting
the winner for each match and create a model as accurate as possible
based on sources other than FIFA rankings. Finally, the analysis will be
concluded by highlighting the best performing model and the features
contributing to such results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Models-and-Predictors">
<h2>Models and Predictors<a class="headerlink" href="#Models-and-Predictors" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Potential models to test out: One vs All Logistic Regression and
Multinomial Logistic Regression - the linearity in coefficients might
give us an insight into what features might be relevant Random Forest -
the go-to out of box model for classifications due to generally good
performance even with little tuning XGBoost - tree gradient boosting
method that performs the best in Kaggle competitions amongst
non-ensemble models Neural networks - if we can find enough data, then
this might be a good idea to test out Potential predictors that we
believe it might help in the analysis: Win rate of teams in the past 4
years - indicating how victorious the team might be overall since high
win rate teams might keep winning and low win rate just keep losing Mean
FIFA 18 rankings of players on each team - a summary of team strength to
help determine which team is stronger Proportion of veterans and new
players in each team - can be a penalty factor on the team strength if
too many new players as coordination might be lacking Historical
head-to-head win rate between each team - some teamâs strategies/style
might have an advantage over certain teams Average player strength of
each team, derived by league match performances - again another summary
of team strength</p>
<p>Output: Multinomial classification - predicting the outcome of the match
as win (team 1 wins), draw, lose (team 2 wins) ## Sources of
Predictors/Data fifa.com: Provides the rankings of the national teams.
In particular,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank=287/index.html">https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank=287/index.html</a>
provides the ranking of teams on June 7, 2018, just before the world
cup. We need to scrape this link using BeautifulSoup in order to make a
baseline model.</p>
<p>The staff has provided several datasets on current players and their
ratings scraped from sofifa.com. We can also scrape player data from the
past.</p>
<p>The staff has also provided us a dataset of past international matches
(international_results.csv). This dataset tells us the home team, away
team, home score, away score, tournament type, city, country, and
neutrality for each match. There are also some results for the 2018
World Cup, which we will have to remove. We also have to explicitly
calculate the winner of each match, which can be easily engineered by
the difference in home score and away score (&gt; 0 means home team win, =
0 means draw, and &lt; 0 means away team win. Then map home team win to 1,
home team loss to 0, and draw to 2). Then, this dataset would become a
good basis for the training data. We might have to only keep data after
a certain time due to the lack of data on players, change in conditions
of countries, etc. from other data sources (Maybe after 2014?).</p>
<p>Wikipedia lists out the squads of each participating country in each
World Cup (i.e.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_squads">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_squads</a>
for 2018. Replace 2018 with 2014 for 2014 squads, etc.). We can scrape
this data and give each team an average rating for each position based
on the players.</p>
<p>Wikipedia also has demographic information about each country. There
might be some correlation between variables such as real GDP, real GDP
per capita, with the performance of the national team. We would need to
scrape this data using BeautifulSoup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Relevant-Features-Engineering">
<h2>Relevant Features Engineering<a class="headerlink" href="#Relevant-Features-Engineering" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>For filling the missing values, we are considering: 1. dropping the
observations; 2. Imputing using other sources; 3. Imputing using linear
regression or K-means where the feature containing missing values is
treated as the dependent variable and other predictors are set as
independent variables. We plan to create some aggregated features, such
as the average strength of the players in the team, mean rankings of the
players etc. as mentioned above in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predictors</span></code> section. After
obtaining all the data, we will standardize non-categorical and
non-percentage variable to make them on a comparable scale. Using
logistic regression, we might try to control for some features to remove
potentially irrelevant features. Another way of approaching this would
be to use PCA to carry out dimensionality reduction. Finally, we will
try to remove outliers by using 1.5 IQR or variance inflation factor
methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Metrics-and-Losses">
<h2>Metrics and Losses<a class="headerlink" href="#Metrics-and-Losses" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>We plan to consider two metrics to evaluate our models. The first one is
the accuracy of the predictions since we ultimately want to see what
percentage of the time the model correctly predicts. The second is the
negative log loss since we also care about how confident our model was
in each of its right/wrong prediction. The loss that we will try to
minimize is the sum of negative log loss as this will tell us how
confident our model was when our prediction was correct and how far off
we were when our prediction was wrong. In addition, log loss can also be
easily adapted for multi-class classifications.</p>

<h2>Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#Preliminary-Exploratory-Data-Analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Intuitively, we would think that a teamâs recent win rate is a good
indicator of their performance in the World Cup. As such, we decided to
look at a teamâs win rate from 2014 to just before the world cup for
teams in the 2018 World Cup. As we see, the teams with the highest win
rate are indeed some of the top tier teams.</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="../_images/playerrating.jpg" /></p>
<p>We also used data from sofifa provided by the staff get individual
player ratings. We used the summary statistic âOverallâ, which is a
common measure of a playerâs ability and performance. We then plotted a
boxplot of the top 23 players ratings for each participating nation.
Intuitively, this would give us an intuition into the spread of players
ability for each participating nation. We can see that there are teams
that are âtop heavyâ, and are over-reliant on a few good players
(i.e.&nbsp;Argentina and Portugal).</p>
