The most simple way to do so that also makes sense is to take the difference of home team features with away team features, as we can think of these as being difference in skills/abilities of the teams. \n"

    "The other baseline model utilizes the FIFA rankings as well as some basic team features, including difference in attack ratings, difference in defense ratings, and difference in midfield ratings. Through classification methods such as logistic regression, LDA, QDA, and Random Forest, we were able to achieve around 60% accuracy in predicting the World Cup results. We hope to at least match this accuracy in our more advanced model that does not utilize the FIFA rankings.\n",

    "## Problems Encountered and Attempts to Solve the Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the largest issues we encountered after we collected all the data was that we realized that we will not be able to merge all the rows. There are two different underlying problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Different Naming Conventions for Countries, Players, and Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset we collected had a different naming convention for the countries. In most cases, this was due to slight variation in spelling (i.e. St Lucia vs Saint Lucia). With all these different variations, we needed to map all the variations to just one name so that we could merge our datasets. We decided to use the official FIFA names of the countries found using the FIFA rankings dataset as the mapped names. Then, in order to tackle this problem, we decided to install the package [fuzzywuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy), which essentially calculates a similarity score using Levenshtein Distance between two strings. We wrote the method `map_country()` that essentially calculates the Levenshtein Distance for a country_name string if the country_name string does not exactly match with the FIFA names and map the string to the FIFA name with the highest similarity score (in percentage). We only do this mapping if the highest similarity score is above a 80%, when we are very confident that this is the right mapping. From manual inspection, this turned out extremely well and we believe that there should be no wrong mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some cases, we still needed to do some manual mapping for ones in which the Levenshtein Distance is not confident about the mapping, such as in the case of the two Koreas, but the `map_country()` function has saved us from doing many manual mappings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Non-FIFA Affiliated Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "There were teams that were not national teams at all (i.e. United Koreans in Japan, which is a team for the Korean population in Japan). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as mentioned before, in the end, we only care about the national teams that are affiliated with FIFA. As such, we only keep the rows where both teams appeared on the FIFA rankings starting from 2010 (All affiliated teams are ranked, and we only look after 2010 because some countries that were on older rankings no longer exist or changed names such as Zaire, which became Congo DR). Our method `map_country()` in `map_countries.py` easily takes care of this since in general there is no similarity score that is above 80% (except for a few edge cases such as Northern Cyprus, which is a different team than Cyprus and is not allowed to compete in FIFA). These we manually took care of.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aftermath for 1. and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, however, we decided to scrap all of this effort since our main goal is to be able to predict the winner of each match in the World Cup, we decided to focus on the teams that have appeared in the World Cup before. By doing so, we basically rendered all the above effort pointless, but one can still see our code for all of this in the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Correctly Matching the Players of a Team\n",
    "\n",
    "While different naming conventions for countries did not prove much of a problem, different datasets having different naming conventions for the players themselves proved to be a major problem. Our attempts with fuzzy matching did not turn out turn out that successful in this case. This is exacerbated by the fact that there were actually a lot more players with the same name than we expected there to be (especially in the case of Brazil). \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/danilo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While theoretically one could match the right player in the players with the same names with the club they played for, the clubs themselves also had different naming conventions, so correctly matching players would result in a TON of manual work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the main reasons we decided to try out the European Soccer Database to see if individual player ratings could be of use before we attempted anything further with player data since in that dataset we could identify each player by a unique id, and from the EDA, we saw that individual data did not really help at all. As such, we decided to forgo on using indiviual player data.\n",
