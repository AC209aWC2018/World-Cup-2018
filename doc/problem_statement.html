<p>While soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, its
analytics is lackluster in comparison to other popular sports such as
baseball, American football, hockey, and basketball. This is
particularly evident for the FIFA World Cup. The amount of analytics
done on the FIFA World Cup is just miniscule in comparison to its scale,
given that it is one of the most popular and highly televised sporting
events in the world! This can be attributed to the general resistance of
the sport (or FIFA) towards technology. Even though numerous other
sports already use video technology to review plays while on the pitch,
FIFA World Cup 2018 was the first time Video Assistant Referee (VAR) was
used in a major soccer tournament.</p>

</center><p>Another possible explanation is it’s uniqueness as a sporting event of a
global scale. The only other comparison is the Olympics. As a result, it
is just logistically difficult for international teams to play each
other very frequently! In fact, soccer clubs are often very resistant to
allowing their players leave for international friendlies, especially if
it is in the middle of their sporting season.</p>

</center><p>As countries just do not compete against each other at the highest level
frequently, there is a lack of high quality data that can be immediately
fed into models to perform predictions. This is one of the biggest
limitations on our project. While we would have liked to construct a
model based on historical match based statistics, such as the possesion
rate, the number of shots on target, etc., these data are just not
readily available (free). Most of these statistics for international
matches seem to have been calculated only since the start of the 2010s.
Even then, only matches at the highest level, during tournaments or
featuring top teams, have these statistics available. As such, we rely
on a mix of simple match based statistics, and team and individual data
from the popular FIFA games for our World Cup predictions.</p>
<p>The World Cup is composed of 64 matches in total - 48 matches in group
stages and 16 matches in knockout (15 + 1 for third place). We plan to
predict the outcome of each of the 64 matches independently instead of
predicting which teams proceed in each round. This strategy allows our
results to be comparable across models. By framing the problem in this
way, we plan to approach this problem as a classification problem. Each
game can be treated as a multi-class classification problem, where there
are three outcomes: win for the home team (or team 1, indicated with 1),
win for the away team (or team 2, indicated with -1), or a draw
(indicated with 0). In the knockout rounds, we limit the outcome to: win
for the home team (or team 1), win for the away team (or team 2), as
draws are not allowed. Note that while we refer to teams as ‘home’ or
‘away’, we are merely abusing the terminology to distinguish between
teams. There is only one true ‘home’ team for World Cups.</p>
<p>To validate how accurate FIFA rankings are, we aim to use a baseline
model that leverages FIFA rankings and some other simple team predictors
to predict the World Cup results. We plan to create a more advanced
model without relying on FIFA rankings. Instead, our advanced model is
based on features that we self collected and engineered. The feature
engineering process is a follow up to our initial EDA, where we
identified features that could possibly impact match results.
Ultimately, our analysis attempts to create a model that can predict the
World Cup results as accurately as possible, while offering an insight
into the features helpful in soccer analytics.</p>
