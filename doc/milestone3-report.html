<h2>Project Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#Project-Statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, its
analytics is lackluster in comparison to other popular sports such as
baseball, American football, hockey, and basketball. This is due to the
fact that aside from the World Cup, international teams don’t play each
other very frequently. Therefore, there is a lack of high quality data
that can be immediately fed into models to perform predictions.</p>
<p>The World Cup is composed of 64 matches in total - 48 matches in group
stages and 16 matches in knockout (15 + 1 for third place). We plan to
predict the outcome of each of the 64 matches independently instead of
predicting which teams proceed in each round. This strategy allows our
results to be comparable across models. By framing the problem in this
way, we plan to approach this problem as a classification problem. Each
game can be treated as a multi-class classification problem, where there
are three outcomes: win for the home team (or team 1, indicated with 1),
win for the away team (or team 2, indicated with -1), or a draw
(indicated with 0). In the case of knockouts, we limit the outcome to:
win for the home team (or team 1), win for the away team (or team 2), as
draws are not allowed.</p>
<p>To validate how accurate FIFA rankings are, we aim to use a baseline
model that leverages FIFA rankings and some other simple predictors to
predict the World Cup results. We plan to create a more advanced model,
without relying on FIFA rankings but instead based on features collected
and engineered by us that are proven to be relevant in the initial EDA.
Ultimately, our analysis attempts to create a model that can predict the
World Cup results as accurately as possible, while offering an insight
into the features helpful in soccer analytics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Description-of-Data">
<h2>Description of Data<a class="headerlink" href="#Description-of-Data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Rankings and outcomes</strong>: As the baseline model relies on FIFA ranking,
we obtained the rankings, points and the corresponding changes from
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/tadhgfitzgerald/fifa-international-soccer-mens-ranking-1993now">FIFA international men teams’ rankings from August 1993 to June
2018</a>.
FIFA outcomes between 1872 and 2017 dataset from Kaggle is used to
construct the dependent variables for our training and validation sets.
Similarly, we found <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/djh_or/2018-world-cup-stats/blob/master/world_cup_2018_stats.csv">World Cup 2018
Stats</a>
to construct our test set results. In addition, we scraped from
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_squads">Wikipedia: World Cup
Teams</a> for
countries involved in The World Cup at the given year
(<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXXX_FIFA_World_Cup_squads">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXXX_FIFA_World_Cup_squads</a>, where XXXX is
the year).</p>
<p><strong>Player and team statistics</strong>: Player data, which include ratings,
positional data and wages, is provided from sofifa.com and also
collected from other sources, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">European
matches</a>. However, as it
was infeasible to reconcile the different naming conventions from
different datasets for players’ name along with a lot more players with
the same name than we expected there to be (especially in the case of
Brazil), it became an infesiable task to uniquely identify the players.
This would require an extensive effort to manually curate the data,
which would yield minimal benefit according to our EDA (see EDA section
for details). Thus, we only aggregated the summary statistics of players
data for each team to approximate the talent available in each team
rather than inspecting the invidual statistics of each player.</p>
<p><strong>Country statistics</strong>: Looking at the past World Cup champions, we
noticed that the stronger teams tend to be the more economically wealthy
ones in their own confederations. Therefore, we scraped from Wikipedia
information about countries like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)">GDP
PPP</a>
and
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)">population</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed description of each collected feature</strong> can be found in the
following notebook
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/AC209aWC2018/World-Cup-2018/blob/master/doc/Feature%20Descriptions.ipynb">here</a></p>
<div class="section" id="Data-Cleaning">
<h3>Data Cleaning<a class="headerlink" href="#Data-Cleaning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We relied on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sqlite3</span></code> to query from European Soccer Database and web
scrapers to scrape from Wikipedia. One of the key challenges involves
matching different naming conventions for countries, players and teams
used by each data source. In most cases, this was due to slight
variation in spelling (i.e.&nbsp;St Lucia vs Saint Lucia). With all these
different variations, we needed to map all the variations to just one
name so that we could merge our datasets. We wrote the method
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">map_country()</span></code>, using
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy">fuzzywuzzy</a>, that
essentially calculates the Levenshtein Distance for a country_name
string if the country_name string does not exactly match with the FIFA
names and map the string to the FIFA name with the highest similarity
score (in percentage). We only do this mapping if the highest similarity
score is above a 80%, when we are very confident that this is the right
mapping. From manual inspection, this turned out extremely well and we
believe that there should be no wrong mapping. However, in some cases,
we still needed to do some manual mapping for ones in which the
Levenshtein Distance is not confident about the mapping, such as in the
case of the two Koreas, but the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">map_country()</span></code> function has saved us
from doing many manual mappings.</p>
<p>In addition, there were teams that were not national teams at all
(i.e.&nbsp;United Koreans in Japan, which is a team for the Korean population
in Japan). However, as mentioned before, in the end, we only care about
the national teams that are affiliated with FIFA. As such, we only keep
the rows where both teams appeared on the FIFA rankings starting from
2006 (All affiliated teams are ranked, and we only look after 2006
because some countries that were on older rankings no longer exist or
changed names such as Zaire, which became Congo DR). Our method
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">map_country()</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">map_countries.py</span></code> easily takes care of this
since in general there is no similarity score that is above 80% (except
for a few edge cases such as Northern Cyprus, which is a different team
than Cyprus and is not allowed to compete in FIFA). These we manually
took care of.</p>

<div class="section" id="Feature-Engineering">
<h3>Feature Engineering<a class="headerlink" href="#Feature-Engineering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Representation of home and away team</strong>: Because in the case of the
World Cup, home team does not actually mean anything (besides for
Russia itself), we needed each feature in our models to be agnostic
to which team is home and which team is away so that so that
switching home team and away team does not result in different
predictions despite everything else being the same. The simplest way
to do so that also makes sense is to take the difference of home team
features with away team features, as we can think of these as being
difference in skills/abilities of the teams.</li>
<li><strong>Missing value representation</strong>: As some of the statistics, such as
attack, defense and midfield ratings, we are interested in are only
collected from FIFA 06 onwards, our training data starts from 2006.
This has, for the most part, also solved the missing values issues
present in the datasets. For the remaining missing values, we imputed
them with 0 as our data is represented in differences between 2
teams, and 0 encodes the lack of information which gives neither
advantage nor disadvantage to any team.</li>
<li><strong>Momentum</strong>: In sports, we can often notice that one team tends to
keep winning or keep losing as they gain momentum due to teams’
morale, conditions and other factors. This can be represented by
taking into account exponential moving average of the number of wins
in the past games.</li>
<li><strong>Wage of players</strong>: One of the most simplest and effective ways to
judge the quality of a team is to calculate the total wage of the
players in that team as clubs tend to pay higher wages for better
players. For the players without wage report, we impute using the
average wage in the country where the player belongs.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics of players</strong>: We aggregate players’ statitics together
as part of a team’s offensive, defensive abilities. One exception is
the goalkeepers’ ratings, as they are essential in preventing the
opposing team from scoring and is the only category with a clearly
defined role. Thus, we single out goalkeepers’ ratings and include
them as part of the features.</li>
<li><strong>GDP within the same confederation</strong>: Rather than considering the
overall GDP difference, GDP difference within the same confederation
seems a better indicator of how well a team is doing against another.
When not in the same confederation, this is encoded again with 0 to
indicate the lack of information which gives neither advantage nor
disadvantage to any team.</li>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#Exploratory-Data-Analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this dataset, we focused primarily on seeing if individual player
statistics were important predictors of the outcome of a match. We
aggregated for each team different player statistics and differenced the
aggregates. From looking at the plots the distributions of a difference
in rating among the three outcome do not really seem that different.
This might be an indication that using individual ratings and
aggregating them might not be the way to go.</p>

<div class="section" id="Exploring-Other-Features">
<h2>Exploring Other Features<a class="headerlink" href="#Exploring-Other-Features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><img alt="Spearman Correlation Plot" src="../_images/spear_corr.png" /> The spearman correlation plot gives us an
idea of how well these features correlate with our dependent variable.
In other words, the highly correlated features, such as overall
difference in ratings should give us a fairly good idea of team 1/home
team winning.</p>
<p><img alt="Distribution Plot" src="../_images/distr_plot.png" /> In fact, from the distribution plot we see that the
features, such as overall difference in ratings and goalkeeper rating
difference, that can better discriminate win, loss for team 1 are more
highly correlated with the win/lose. Similarly, features, such as build
up dribbling difference, which have low correlation barely show any
difference between distribution of different outcomes.</p>
<p><img alt="Goal Rating" src="../_images/goal_rating.png" /> Inspecting one of the highly correlated features closely,
we see that when the difference is positive (team 1 has an advantage),
the likelihood of winning is much higher whereas when it’s negative it’s
much more likely to lose.</p>
<p><img alt="Wage Difference" src="../_images/wage_diff.png" /> However, there are also some features that don’t have
really high correlation and can still discriminate well the win/lose
situations when the difference is large. For instance, for the team wage
difference, we see when the difference is large, it is much more likely
to win/lose, but there is barely any difference in the middle peaking at
0. This is happening because we imputed missing values with 0 to encode
lack of information. In fact, in these cases we have a lot of
distributions with a really high peak at 0, causing low correlation.
Nonetheless, they can still be useful when we do possess the
information.</p>
<p>In addition, it seems that previous match results will be good
predictors. This time it is a bit more obvious that home team winning
tends to have higher values. It seems like we can probably calculate
some kind of momentum and utilize it as a predictor. We will explore
more of this concept later on when we try to make more advanced models.</p>

<div class="section" id="Exploring-PCA">
<h2>Exploring PCA<a class="headerlink" href="#Exploring-PCA" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inspecting these distribution of features, we noticed them a large
proportion of them are similarly shaped and distributed. Therefore, we
considered PCA to perform dimensionality reduction, aggregating similar
features.</p>
<p>To check how useful PCA is, we find the validation performance of cross
validated models over different number of PCA components and compare it
against the cross validated models on the data without PCA.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id3">
<img alt="PCA Results" src="../_images/pca_res.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">PCA Results</span></p>
</div>
<p>First of all, we notice that PCA helps models like LDA and QDA perhaps
because of the independent assumption of components imposed by PCA. On
the other hand, the performance for Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
XGBoost seem to be slightly hurt by the reduced information from PCA.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we see that the best model is QDA with 9 components from
PCA. This probably means that performing dimensionality reduction is
probably quite helpful in summarizing the information from the data with
similar distributions. We will keep this in mind when picking the final
model.</p>

<p>We have two different simple baseline models. For the naive one, we just
guess the majority outcome every time (home team wins). By just guessing
the majority outcome every time, we could achieve a 42.1875% accuracy in
predicting the World Cup results.</p>
<p>The other baseline model utilizes the FIFA rankings as well as some
basic team features, including difference in attack ratings, difference
in defense ratings, and difference in midfield ratings. Through
classification methods such as logistic regression, LDA, QDA, Random
Forest and XGBoost and cross validation, we picked LDA as the final
baseline model as it gave the highest validation accuracy.</p>

<p>With this model, we were able to achieve around 59.4% accuracy in
predicting the 2018 World Cup results. We hope to at least match this
accuracy in our more advanced model that does not utilize the FIFA
rankings.</p>
<p>Note that because in the World Cup starting from the Round of 16 there
can no longer be ties, we decided for these matches if the model
predicts a tie (i.e.&nbsp;tie is the highest probability), we take the result
with the second highest probability as our prediction. For this reason,
the test accuracy is also higher because half of the matches can only
have 2 outcomes instead of 3.</p>
