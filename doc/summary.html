<h2>Conclusions and Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#Conclusions-and-Summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this project we explored the idea of predicting the 2018 World Cup
through a data science approach. We collected data related to matches,
team and player ratings, and FIFA rankings. We use international matches
starting from 2006 as our training set. However, due to the limitations
of the sofifa dataset, we had to get rid of many matches when merging
with the matches dataset with the sofifa dataset. Nonetheless, as we
have already explained, this was necessary given that the sofifa dataset
is the most comprehensive database on soccer players. The training set
has three outcomes, home team loses, draws, or wins. We abuse the
terminology ‘home’ in order to distinguish between teams. As such, even
though our dataset designates one team as home team, it does not mean
anything. In fact, as each observation in our dataset is a match, any
feature we use are actually symmetric in nature.</p>
<p>Due to the elimination style of the knockout stages of the World Cup,
there are no draws in these matches. We attempted different approaches
to predicting the outcome of the knockout stages matches. The first
approach is to predict the outcome at 90 minutes (when a regular game
ends so that our train set and test set are more “similar” to each
other) before accounting for penalty kicks and extra time. This allows
our trained model to also predict draws in the knockout stages of the
World Cup. In the second approach, we predicted the outcome at the end
of the match; for a knockout stage match, if the model predicts a draw
with the highest probability, we instead select the outcome with the
second highest probability. Our third approach also attempts to predict
the outcome at the end of the match. However, we specifically train a
separate model on past World Cup knockout stages matches. This model
will then be used to predict the outcomes of knockout stages matches. We
continue using our original trained model on the group stages matches.</p>
<p>We wanted to see the reliability of FIFA rankings in determining the
relative strength of a team. As such, we built a baseline model
consisting of just FIFA rankings, and the attack ratings, defense
ratings, midfield ratings, and overall ratings of the teams from the
FIFA games. We tried out a variety of classification methods such as
logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic
discriminant analysis, random forest, and XGBoost, using
cross-validation to train on the models and ultimately selecting the
model with the highest validation accuracy. With this model, we achieved
decent predictions on World Cup 2018. Also, with the baseline model, we
realized that FIFA rankings do not have that much of an impact on the
outcome of the matches, indicating that a model without FIFA rankings
can achieve better results than the baseline model if we feature
engineer good features.</p>
<p>Through reviewing past works and exploratory data analysis, we decided
to use a much broader range of features, such as the average squad age,
the GDP per capita of countries overall and on the same continent
(proxying for GDP of teams in the same football confederation), a team’s
playing style and tactics, the momentum of a team from their last few
matches, etc. These new features were scraped from different web
sources, and subsequently feature engineered on for our predictive
model.</p>
<p>Similar to the baseline model, we first tried a variety of
classification methods and used cross-validation to train the various
models. We then selected the model with the highest validation accuracy
to use. With this model, we achieved considerable increases to our test
accuracies. In order to further improve the test accuracies, we also
experimented with stacking. However, there was no great improvements in
test accuracies. This process highlighted to us that we might have to
deal with the multicollineariy nature of our features. As such, we
utilized dimension reduction techniques to conduct Principal Component
Regression and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis. In the end
we saw that Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was comparable
to the full model, and better in the case of the second approach.</p>
<p>We also tried out a simple neural network just for educational purposes,
and while it performed better than the baseline model, it did not really
perform as well as the more advanced models, which is not surprising due
to our small training set.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, based on the Softmax approach evaluation we have managed to
improve a simple baseline relying on FIFA rankings and some simple
statistics from 59.4% accuracy for the World Cup to 68.8% for our best
advanced model, PLS1, based on the validation set.</p>

<h2>Future Work<a class="headerlink" href="#Future-Work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As shown, the models we built have already shown decent results, but of
course there is always room for improvement. The immediate next step to
take is to think of more complex features that might affect the outcome
of a match. An important category of features that we feel would greatly
improve our model is match statistics, such as in-game possesion, number
of shots on target, number of fouls conceded, number of tackles
completed, etc. These statistics, as compared to our current data, are
more ‘raw’, as there is no inherent bias in the data. While these data
can still be found for club matches, especially for the larger European
leagues, it is difficult to be found for international matches,
especially for lesser-known teams.</p>
<p>These match statistics could also be extended to ‘purer’ individual
statistics that measure the number of take-ons completed, the number of
critical passes, the percentage of passes completed, etc. for individual
players. These statistics can easily be applied to our predictive model
through a moving average approach similar to our momentum predictors.
They would allow us to better measure the performance of a player, and
explore the impact of individual players on the match. While team
ratings may capture an aggregate view of the players, we would like to
be even more granular to see if individual players can “carry” their
teams.</p>
<p>We are hopeful that the data limitations in soccer analytics on the
international stage would become resolved as the field becomes more
developed and centralized; eventually a website or database like
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">https://www.baseball-reference.com/</a> will be built, but for soccer. In
fact, Opta Sports is a relatively new company that gathered substantial
match data during the World Cup 2018, and often collects match data for
European leagues. While it might be impossible to recollect historical
data for past international matches, it is our hope that the right match
statistics are collected in the present for future analysis.</p>

<p>This project proves that there is a lot of potential for the field to
expand. There is no doubt in the future we will see teams rely heavily
on analytics to make decision, just like how baseball, basketball and
American football do in the current era.</p>
