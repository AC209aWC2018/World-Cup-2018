<h1>Description of Data<a class="headerlink" href="#Description-of-Data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Rankings and outcomes:</strong> As the baseline model relies on FIFA ranking,
we obtained the rankings, points and the corresponding changes from FIFA
international men teams’ rankings from August 1993 to June 2018.
National team outcomes between 1872 and 2018 dataset provided by the
staff is used to construct the dependent variables for our training and
validation sets. Similarly, we found World Cup 2018 Stats to construct
our test set results.</p>
<p><strong>Player and team statistics:</strong> Player data, which include ratings,
positional data and wages, is provided from sofifa.com and also
collected from other sources, such as European matches. However, as
there were different naming conventions across different datasets for
players’ name, it would be difficult to accurately match player names
without some extensive manual curation. Moreover, this would yield
minimal benefit according to our EDA (see EDA section for details).
Thus, we only aggregated the summary statistics of players data for each
team to approximate the talent available in each team rather than
inspecting the individual statistics of each player.</p>
<p><strong>Country statistics:</strong> Looking at the past World Cup champions, we
noticed that the stronger teams tend to be the economically wealthier
ones in their own continents. Therefore, we scraped from Wikipedia
information about countries like GDP PPP and population.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Representation of home and away team:</strong> As a soccer match involves
2 teams, we needed our models to be agnostic to whether a team is
home or away. This ensures that swapping home and away teams does not
change our predictions. The simplest way to do so is to take the
difference of team features. As such, we can think of our predictors
as differences in skills/abilities of teams.</li>
<li><strong>Missing value representation:</strong> Some of the data that we rely on
are based upon the FIFA in-game statistics stored on sofifa.com. As
they only have statistics from FIFA 2006 onwards, our training data
starts from 2006. Importantly, we note that the value and wages data
is missing for less renowned players. In the soccer job market, top
players in European leagues earn substantially more than other soccer
players. As such, it makes sense to impute the missing value and
wages as 0. For the remaining missing values, we imputed them with 0
as our data is represented in differences between 2 teams, and 0
encodes the lack of information which neither advantages nor
disadvantages either team.</li>
<li><strong>Momentum:</strong> In sports, we often notice that one team tends to keep
winning or keep losing as they gain momentum due to teams’ morale,
conditions and other factors. This can be represented by taking
account a team’s win rate in the past couple of games and possibly
the number of goals they scored and were scored against them in the
past couple of games.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics of players:</strong> We aggregate players’ statistics together
as part of a team’s offensive, defensive abilities. One exception is
the goalkeepers’ ratings, as we believe that defense is pivotal for
any team. Good goalkeepers can potentially swing the outcome of a
match. As such, we single out goalkeepers’ ratings and include them
as part of the features.</li>
<li><strong>GDP within the same continent:</strong> Rather than considering the
overall GDP difference, GDP difference within the same continent
seems a better indicator of how well a team is doing against another.
When not in the same continent, this is encoded again with 0 to
indicate the lack of information which neither advantages nor
disadvantage any team.</li>
