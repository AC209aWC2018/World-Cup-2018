    "For the advanced models, we choose PLS1-DA as our final model given the highest validation score across these advanced models. In fact, this final model also resulted in significant improvements over the baseline model for all different approaches of evaluating the test set, World Cup 2018. Based on the Softmax approach, which resembles World Cup format most closely, the improvement has gone from 59.4% to 68.8%! \n",
    "\n",
    "Since for this best model we aggregated the features together through dimensionality reduction to alleviate multicollinearity, we cannot comment on which advanced features have directly helped the improvement on the model. Based on our EDA analysis and feature importance produced by Random Forest as a proxy, we believe this improvement is a result of features such as, GDP per capita both overall and within confedenration, momentum, wage and goalkeeper ratings. In fact, these along with other team ratings statistics are shown to be highly correlated with the predictor variable and are ranked high in feature importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, one concerning part noted is that validation score of the baseline is higher than our advanced models, which is perhaps caused by these advanced features. In fact, we have come up with these features based on World Cup matches that we saw, biasing the advanced models more towards World Cup matches, hurting them during validation which contains more casual matches, such as friendlies, possibly affected by different factors. Nonetheless, these priors seem to hold for more serious matches, such as World Cups, based on our observations, resulting in a significant improvement using our final advanced model."
