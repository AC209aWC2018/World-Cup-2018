    "Out of plain curiosity, we wondered how a simple neural network would perform on our problem (Everyone wants to try deep learning nowadays). Because our training set is so small, we do not believe that the neural network will outperform any of our models from the previous part. In fact, it might overfit to the training set and perform worse than our other models. This notebook is just to experiment around with neural networks and see its performance on a small dataset. We will only look at the outcome at 90 minutes and Softmax in the test set, since it would be pretty complicated to come up with a scheme for the WC Playoff Model configuration, especially since there are so few WC playoff matches in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simple neural network had a total of 3 hidden node layers, with 15 nodes in each layer. We added regularization on each layer and also add drop out layers to try to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Surprisngly, the neural network actually did better than we thought it would. This most likely stems from the regularization we added as well as the dropout layers. However, the neural network stilldid not perform as well as our best model.\n",

    "We have thus shown that neural networks do not really help improve accuracy in this small dataset; it shows that we do not really need that complex of a model in this problem.\n",
