    "**Rankings and outcomes:** As the baseline model relies on FIFA ranking, we obtained the rankings, points and the corresponding changes from FIFA international men teams' rankings from August 1993 to June 2018. National team outcomes between 1872 and 2018 dataset provided by the staff is used to construct the dependent variables for our training and validation sets. Similarly, we found World Cup 2018 Stats to construct our test set results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Player and team statistics:** Player data, which include ratings, positional data and wages, is provided from sofifa.com and also collected from other sources, such as European matches. However, as there were different naming conventions across different datasets for players' name, it would be difficult to accurately match player names without some extensive manual curation. Moreover, this would yield minimal benefit according to our EDA (see EDA section for details). Thus, we only aggregated the summary statistics of players data for each team to approximate the talent available in each team rather than inspecting the individual statistics of each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Country statistics:** Looking at the past World Cup champions, we noticed that the stronger teams tend to be the economically wealthier ones in their own continents. Therefore, we scraped from Wikipedia information about countries like GDP PPP and population.\n",

    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Representation of home and away team:** As a soccer match involves 2 teams, we needed our models to be agnostic to whether a team is home or away. This ensures that swapping home and away teams does not change our predictions. The simplest way to do so is to take the difference of team features. As such, we can think of our predictors as differences in skills/abilities of teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing value representation:** Some of the data that we rely on are based upon the FIFA in-game statistics stored on sofifa.com. As they only have statistics from FIFA 2006 onwards, our training data starts from 2006. Importantly, we note that the value and wages data is missing for less renowned players. In the soccer job market, top players in European leagues earn substantially more than other soccer players. As such, it makes sense to impute the missing value and wages as 0. For the remaining missing values, we imputed them with 0 as our data is represented in differences between 2 teams, and 0 encodes the lack of information which neither advantages nor disadvantages either team. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Momentum:** In sports, we often notice that one team tends to keep winning or keep losing as they gain momentum due to teams' morale, conditions and other factors. This can be represented by taking account a team's win rate in the past couple of games and possibly the number of goals they scored and were scored against them in the past couple of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistics of players:** We aggregate players' statistics together as part of a team's offensive, defensive abilities. One exception is the goalkeepers' ratings, as we believe that defense is pivotal for any team. Good goalkeepers can potentially swing the outcome of a match. As such, we single out goalkeepers' ratings and include them as part of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **GDP within the same continent:** Rather than considering the overall GDP difference, GDP difference within the same continent seems a better indicator of how well a team is doing against another. When not in the same continent, this is encoded again with 0 to indicate the lack of information which neither advantages nor disadvantage any team."
